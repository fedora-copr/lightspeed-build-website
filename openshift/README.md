# OpenShift deployment

At this time, the `log-detective` website is deployed in Fedora
CommuniShift.

- Dashboard: https://console-openshift-console.apps.fedora.cj14.p1.openshiftapps.com/
- Documentation: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/ocp4/sop_communishift/

## Tools

For some reason, in the Fedora repositories, there is an outdated
(version 3.x) `oc` command (the `origin-clients` package). You might
need to install it like this

https://docs.okd.io/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html

## Permissions

To be able to access the OpenShift project please ping fedora-infra to
add you to [communishift][group1] group and @FrostyX, to add you to
[communishift-log-detective][group2] group.

## Login

First, log in using the OpenShift dashboard URL, then click your name
in the top-right and "Copy login command". Display token and run the
`oc` command.

```bash
oc login --token=... --server=https://api.fedora.cj14.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
```

## Build

The production container uses code from
https://github.com/fedora-copr/log-detective-website
so commit and push your changes.

Build the container image:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml build --no-cache
```

or

```bash
make build-prod
```

Push the image to quay.io
[quay.io/log-detective][quay-organization]:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml push
```

or

```bash
make push-prod
```

Alternatively, when working with github repo, the image can be published
by simply creating a tag with name respecting [semver](https://semver.org/) convention.
This will trigger github action in `docker-publish.yml`.

New image will be created with the same tag and pushed to quay.io.
Tag `latest` will also be updated to point to the new image.

The best way to publish an image is to make a new release of the project,
using the github [dialog](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release).
This will also generate release notes.

## Pull Image

Alternativelly you can use existing image.
Pre-build images are available at quay.io/log-detective, semantically versioned,
with versions correponding to tags of this repo.

```bash
docker pull quay.io/log-detective/website:latest
```

Images are build and pushed with every new tag by a github action.


## Deploy

Make sure you are using the correct OpenShift project

```
oc project communishift-log-detective
```

If a Kubernetes/OpenShift configuration change needs to be applied,
run the following command. Otherwise you can skip it.

```
oc apply -f openshift/log-detective.yaml
```

To kill the current deployment and start a fresh, up-to-date
container, run

```
oc rollout restart deploy/log-detective-website
```

You can debug the instance using

```
oc logs -f deploy/log-detective-website
# or
oc rsh deploy/log-detective-website
```

## TLS certificates

This is a copy-pasta of Packit's process: https://github.com/packit/deployment/blob/main/docs/deployment/tls-certs.md
Praise @jpopelka

We will use DNS TXT entries to verify we own the domain. Ping @TomasTomecek to get access to the domain.

Locally:
```
$ dnf install certbot
```

Run certbot in the root of this git repo.
```
$ certbot certonly --config-dir cert/ --work-dir cert/ --logs-dir cert/ --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email ttomecek@redhat.com -d '*.log-detective.com' -d '*.logdetective.com' -d 'log-detective.com' -d 'logdetective.com'
```

We will create one certificate file that will contain data for both
log-detective.com and logdetective.com. With wildcards and naked. We need all
these 4 entries to get https://log... and https://www... working.
```
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:
```

Set those 2 TXT DNS entries for log-detective.com and logdetective.com

Wait for those 2 entries to be up:
```
$ watch -d nslookup -q=TXT _acme-challenge.logdetective.com
```

Alternatively check the record using porkbun's DNS server:
```
$ dig -t txt _acme-challenge.logdetective.com. @curitiba.ns.porkbun.com.
```

You can verify the newly created cert with `openssl` CLI. Here we check that both domains are set as SAN:
```
$ openssl x509 -inform pem -noout -text -in 'cert/live/log-detective.com/fullchain.pem'
...
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                DNS:log-detective.com, DNS:logdetective.com
```

Once verified, you should delete those TXT DNS records.

All certificate stuff is in gitignored cert/ folder.

Copy the content to the running log-detective:
```
$ oc cp cert/ log-detective-website-$pod:/persistent
```

Connect to the pod, back up old certs and rename cert/ to letsencrypt/:
```
$ oc rsh deployment/log-detective-website

$ mv /persistent/letsencrypt{,-old}
$ mv /persistent/{cert,letsencrypt}
```

Kill the running pod so the certs are actually loaded.
